## Computer Vision Capstone Project - Traffic sinal classification

## Source Code

#### 01-preprocessing.ipynb
#### 02-Training-and-Testing.ipynb

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [SciPy library](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)
- [Six](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/)
- [h5py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/h5py/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook. I have tested the code in the 16GB CPU and then processed in the NVIDIA GPU clusters.

## Run

Open Ipython Notebook in the root folder. I learnt that command would be changed to Jupyter Notebook

Open the 5 Files and run their contents one after the other. Some commands take longer than others

## Data

This project uses the The German Traffic Sign Benchmarks Dataset (http://benchmark.ini.rub.de). The German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark is a single-image detection assessment for researchers with interest in the field of computer vision, pattern recognition and image-based driver assistance.

- This is a single-image detection problem
- There are 900 images (devided in 600 training images and 300 evaluation images)
