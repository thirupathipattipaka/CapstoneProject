## Computer Vision Capstone Project - Traffic sinal classification

Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- theano
- keras
- Tensorflow

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

Code

Template code is provided in the student_intervention.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the student-data.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory student_intervention/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
