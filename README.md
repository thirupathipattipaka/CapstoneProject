omputer Vision Capstone Project - Social Image Description Platform

Description

Build a social image description platform where users can upload an image that they would like to have described. The image is then surfaced in other usersâ€™ streams and one or more users describe it. Over time, the system learns associations between words used to describe an image and the visual features found in it, and gets better at predicting descriptions on its own.

For labeling, you can treat a description as a simple bag-of-words. A more advanced model could parse the description string entered by a user to understand sentence structure and semantics, and later generate descriptions that sound natural.
